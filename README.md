# OpenViewer

A fast, no-nonsense book and comic reader for mobile (and eventually desktop). Built on Angular + Ionic + Capacitor so the chrome stays web-native and the renderer can graduate to native code where it matters.

Inspired by Perfect Viewer's "does the basics, does them well" philosophy. Designed for books first, comics second.

## Features (planned)

- Local file browsing with Android 11+ scoped storage (SAF)
- Image viewer: paginated, vertical scroll (webtoon), horizontal scroll
- Smooth pinch / pan / fling with 60fps target
- LTR / RTL reading, brightness / contrast / gamma, white-border crop
- EPUB rendering
- Archive support: CBZ / ZIP, CBR, 7Z, CBT / TAR
- PDF / XPS / DJVU via plugin (later)
- Bookshelf, favorites, bookmarks, recent files
- Network sources (later): SMB / CIFS, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, OPDS
- Cloud sources (later): Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive
- Page cache, slideshow, Chromecast (later)

## v1 scope

Local files + bookshelf + image / comic viewer (paginated + vertical) + EPUB + bookmarks. Everything else is deferred — see `AGENTS.md` for the full scope lock.

## Contributing

Read `AGENTS.md` first — it has the conventions, scope rules, and performance budget that govern this repo. tl;dr:

- Standalone components, signals for state, `inject()` over constructor DI.
- Strict TypeScript. No `*ngIf` / `*ngFor` — use `@if` / `@for`.
- v1 is local files + viewer + EPUB only. Don't sneak in network/cloud/PDF features.
- Smoke-test on a real device before claiming done.
